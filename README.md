# BAG-Converter
A general open source tool to convert the Dutch LVBAG Landelijke Voorziening Basisregistratie Adressen en Gebouwen dataset from XML to any desired spatial or text format. Many tools exist like GDAL, however these tools are big dependancies and are sometimes not desired. This tool is modern and built in rust for high performance.
